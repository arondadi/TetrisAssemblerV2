# To do
==========================================

- Implement a block
	- DONE Draw the sprite block with animatedsprite(without animations)
	- DONE Add collision with player
	- Implement movable on block
		- make function to determine at which direction the collision was
		- touched 
		- pushed
		- grid/pixel based movement
		- Comments:
			- position of block is still from push postion and up to new position
			- maybe have to draw block again


- Change player movement to pixel based movement
