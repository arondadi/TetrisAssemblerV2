	- handle collision gerist 32p frá block

- Create a level or collision class that keeps track of every piece on the board 
	- checks collisions
	- checks possible movements for player/tetramino
	- checks if player can move block



- Implement falling on block

- Implement a block
	- DONE Draw the sprite block with animatedsprite(without animations)
	- DONE Add collision with player
	- Implement movable on block
		- DONE make function to determine at which direction the collision was
		- touched 
		- pushed
		- grid/pixel based movement
		- Comments:
			- position of block is still from push postion and up to new position
			- maybe have to draw block again

# Ideas
===========================================
- Tetris in same window
	- Unassembled blocks explode
	- Non-tetromino shapes do something...
		- Grey out a line
		- Can be blow away
	- Fully assembled tetrominos can be moved by player
- Tetris in an another window with assembly in another
